# HEX Guesser

This is a project undertaken mainly to learn the basics of React, and uses a gameified setting to generate random hex codes and allow the user to guess which colour they correspond to on a colour wheel. 

I have often been interested in utilizing TailwindCSS on a project, but have not found the right opportunity to do so, but have decided to use it in this project and have been thoroughly enjoying the experience provided from the use of React Components and Tailwind.
